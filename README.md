## m_logger - A simple logger that supports multiprocessing

Smaple usage code can be found at [test](./test/)

This project is made to be used internally for some project, so I won't 
be making any more detailed documentation. If you wish to extend this 
package, you may fork it and work from there. 

# Install 
For the time-being, I don't plan on uploading this package on `pypi.org`, so anyone who forks it and extends it, or make it better can upload it to `pypi.org` themselves, I don't plan on doing maintenance on this repo, so I don't want to be responsible for it being indexed on the `pypi.org`. 

To install this package: 
```
git clone https://github.com/shin-illua/m_logger.git
cd m_logger
python setup.py
```
After that, you can now `import m_logger` into your script.
